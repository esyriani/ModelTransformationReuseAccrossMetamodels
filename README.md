# ModelTransformationReuseAccrossMetamodels
Artefacts and materials made available to compare Model Transformation Reuse approaches and techniques

Starting from some results of the [1st Workshop on Unifying Software Reuse](http://www.bellairs2018.ece.mcgill.ca/), this repository aims at collecting (and making available) model transformations reuse approaches.

An initial step consisted in providing:

* a **Feature Model** (available [here](https://github.com/smart-researchteam/ModelTransformationReuseAccrossMetamodels/tree/master/MT-reuse-bellairs) in the form of a [featureIDE](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/featureide) file).
* a list of initial approaches:
  * Model Typing
  * Concepts
  * A-posteriori Typing
  * Multilevel Modeling
  * Design Patterns for Model Transformations
